# ProgressCircle
ProgressCircle is a simple iOS application that simulates a progress bar as a circle. The user can select to progress the circle to 25 percent or 75 percent. The user optionally can reverse the direction of the progress counter clockwise. The user can also change the color of the progress bar and the size/diameter of the circle.
